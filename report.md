##Introduction

The Backpropagation Network is a C language implementation of a neural network simulator, focusing on the backpropagation algorithm. It's primarily used for time-series forecasting, such as predicting the annual number of sunspots. The code includes the definition of the network structure, random number generation functions, and the core algorithms for learning and prediction.
